# ToDos and Planned Genes 

Any help is very appreciated, even if it is just pointing me to existing similar projects. 

## Additions to existing things 

**Cumeater** - Look for edible cum-items when low on Fertilin

**Incubi** - Add a forced striptease Ability

**Age Transfer Genes** - Add (configurable) option to satisfy Bodymodders and their AgeReversalDemand

## Planned Genes 

**Adjustable Cock-Size** like e.g. artificial genitalia have

**Infectious Hypersexuality Gene** (Maybe?) add Hypersexuality Gene through sex with a certain chance. 

**Cum Addiction** add Cum-Addiction from Sexperience, slowly loose conciousness while addiction is not attended.

**Cum-Drugs** eating cum has an effect similar to Go-Juice (including (separate?) addiction)

**Death-Rest** until the pawn is cumflated. 

**STD Immunity** & maybe a potential to be carrier, but not suffer effects. 

## Planned Xenotypes 

**Beastmaster:** 

- [] Animal Mating Call (Get fucked by everything nearby, potentially ending animal rage)
- [] Pheromone Spit that marks a target for being raped by animals 
- [] Power-Boost & Bonding to animals through zoophilia 
- [] Maybe: Boost pregnancy times of Animals
- [] Maybe: Make it Animal-Fertilin-Dependend
- [] Either: Can only eat meat or cannot eat meat 
- [] Gene to prefer hookups of animals that are in a menstrual cycle

Can't help but think about Rexxar Porn now I am a bad person. 

## Genes with Abilities and more Effects 

There were some suggestions on the Discord I saved them somewhere else. I am far away from making that work, but to have them here: 

- Genitalia deal damage as per size (on normal sex-use)
- Genitalia can cause Terror (as ability)
- Cumshot Sniper Abilities

## Cleanups: 

- Streamline Filenames / Names to either be LifeForce or Fertilin (e.g. `Hediffs_Fertilin.xml` but `Pawnkind_LifeForce.xml`). I think most things are called LifeForce. 
- Similar cleanup for the patches, and make a note what to find where in the patches
- Change Project structure to the 1.3, 1.4 Structure of other mods

## Split: 

I plan to split this mod. 
Namely, I want to make a 

1. base-mod (with genitalia and size genes, anything alternating all base stats)
2. bonus-mod, with Fertilin and other complex genes
3. xenotype-mod (only xenotypes + scenarios)
4. animal genes inheritance (Yes, bit of a meme that it was separate mod earlier)

I first want to make a bit more content, and then I hope there will be a "breaking change" in RJW so I can also do a breaking change on top of that.
