# Contributing

Thanks for considering contribution! 
As your help is highly appreciated, there are only three *hard constraints*:

1. Be friendly and patient in issues, PRs and comments.
2. Create code,commits and assets in english. 
3. For Images: Only commit things with clear ownership (e.g. CC3)

But please consider also the following: 

* Please try to make an issue with your idea first or ping me (Vegapunk)
* Keep commit messages on the topic and meaningful
* Give me some time to review things. I can either mod, play or have a life.
