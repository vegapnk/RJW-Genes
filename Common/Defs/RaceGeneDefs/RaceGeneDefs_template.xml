		defName can be anything you want, as long as it is unique
		
		<raceGroups>
			<li>Canine_Group</li>

		RJW.Racegroupdef, all animals in the added raceGroups will be part of this group, RJW race support uses other defnames and overwrite vanilla ones, so add them to if you use it. 
		
		<raceNames>
			<li> </li>
		</raceNames>
		For more direct control you can use raceNames directly. Use the defName of the animal. Can also use modded animals.
		
		<pawnKindNames>
			<li> </li>
		</pawnKindNames>
		For even more direct control you can use pawnKindNames. 
		
		<priority>0</priority> 
		You can use priority incase you have multiple racegenedefs with the same animal under the same list (racegroup, racenames or pawnKindNames). If not assigned the value is 0. Higher priority is chosen.
		
		The RaceGeneDef for an animal will first be decided by if it is in the pawnkindNames, after that racenames and lastly racegroup,
		so if there is for a wolf a RaceGeneDef with the canine group and a second which has wolf under raceNames it will always use the second one to determine
		which genes can be inherited
		
		<genes>
			<li>
				<defName>Ears_Floppy</defName>
				<chance>0.5</chance>
			</li>
			<li>
				<defName>rjw_genes_slime_genitalia</defName> You can add modded genes which will be ignored if the mod is inactive.
				<chance>0.5</chance>
			</li>			
		</genes>		 
		For each gene you need to find the defname and give it a chance to appear. Each gene is rolled independently.

You can use parents to have animals get specific genes in addition to the group. So warg children will have a chance for Ears_Floppy, rjw_genes_slime_genitalia and StrongStomach
