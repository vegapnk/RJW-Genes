<Patch>

	<!-- 
		DevNote:
		There used to be an issue with a Gene-Mod Called "Cum-Addiction Gene". That mod just overwrote the
	complete UsedCondom.xml and Sexperience Cum.xml
		This would lead to two types of failures: 
		A) If this mod was before the other mod, changes were just overwritten
		B) If this mod was after, there was an issue in targetting the XML throwing a patch error
		Please if you write mods, do not just purge out XMLs. Thanks. 

		This patch was kindly mirrored after Infis Patch of UsedCondoms.
