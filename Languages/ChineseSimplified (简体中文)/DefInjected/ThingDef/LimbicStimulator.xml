  <!-- EN: A perpetual slow-release chemical stimulation implant that is embedded deep within the reward center of the brain, greatly increasing the need for lovin'. The need is said to become so strong that it can drive people to force themselves onto others, even if they wouldn't otherwise. Post-lovin' clarity will leave the implanted in a state of bliss, but they may also feel a sense of regret if they steal lovin' if they normally wouldn't - at least until they become used to doing it. -->
  <LimbicStimulator.description>一种永久性的缓释化学刺激植入物，深深嵌入大脑的奖励中心，大大增加了对爱的需求。据说这种需求会强烈到驱使人们委身于他人，即使他们不想这样做。爱的余韵会让植入者处于幸福的状态，但如果是背德的偷情——他们平常所认为的那种——至少在他们习惯之前——他们也可能会感到后悔。</LimbicStimulator.description>
